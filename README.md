## :book: Overview

**3DisoTarget** is a translational extension of **3DisoGalaxy**, designed to address one of the fundamental challenges in precision oncology: **the limited availability of known druggable targets across heterogeneous patient populations**.

By harnessing the comprehensive isoform landscape derived from large-scale alternative splicing in breast cancer — including transcriptome expression, ORF-translated quantification, and 3D structural prediction — this project introduces a novel approach to **identify structurally analogous alternatives to existing therapeutic targets**.

This initiative is not only a demonstration of the potential of **isoform-centric structural modeling**, but also a **bold attempt to overcome the receptor limitation bottleneck** in targeted therapy.

## :sparkles: Key Features

- :triangular_ruler: **Structure-based Target Analog Discovery**  
  Uses isoform 3D structures to mine potential analogs of known therapeutic targets.

- :microscope: **Biological Contextualization**  
  Anchored in differential transcript expression and translated protein quantification from patient-derived datasets.

- :dna: **Alternative Splicing Integration**  
  Built upon a curated isoform universe from the 3DisoGalaxy platform.

- :hammer_and_wrench: **Actionable Insights**  
  Designed to uncover tractable opportunities when canonical targets are absent or ineffective.

- :rocket: **Application-ready**  
  Facilitates downstream modeling and validation for therapeutic development.
