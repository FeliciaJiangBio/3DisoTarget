## ?? Overview

**3DisoTarget** is a conceptual and translational expansion of the 3DisoGalaxy platform, designed to unlock therapeutic opportunities beyond known drug targets — particularly for cancer patients who lack traditional actionable receptors.

Leveraging a structurally annotated atlas of breast cancer protein isoforms — including expression, ORF translation, and 3D structure — **3DisoTarget** matches isoform structures with known target receptors to identify **functionally and structurally analogous isoform alternatives**. This has potential to widen the scope of precision therapy beyond canonical targets.

> "Where no targets exist, structure may still reveal opportunity."

---

## ?? Objectives

- **Extend precision oncology** to patients lacking canonical therapeutic targets
- **Identify target analogs** based on isoform 3D structural similarity
- **Translate alternative splicing biology** into clinically actionable insights
- **Promote innovation** in target discovery pipelines using transcriptomics and structure

---

## ?? Project Highlights

- Based on **3DisoGalaxy**’s proteome-wide isoform structure atlas  
- Incorporates **ORF translation + AlphaFold structure prediction**  
- Cross-references known therapeutic targets from public databases  
- Enables **structure-guided search** for novel, isoform-derived target analogs  
- Intuitive **Jekyll-based interface** powered by GitHub Pages

---

## ?? Biological Relevance

Patients without conventional targets (e.g., HER2-, ER-, PR-) often lack effective therapies. **3DisoTarget** offers a pioneering approach:

| Challenge | Solution via 3DisoTarget |
|----------|--------------------------|
| No known receptor expression | Identify structurally similar isoform analogs |
| Isoform complexity ignored | Incorporate splicing-derived structural diversity |
| Lack of new target hypotheses | Use isoform universe as untapped source |
