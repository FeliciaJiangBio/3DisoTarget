# ?? 3DisoTarget: Expanding Therapeutic Options Beyond Known Targets

**3DisoTarget** is a conceptual extension of the *3DisoGalaxy* platform, aimed at addressing a critical challenge in precision oncology — the absence of actionable drug targets in a subset of patients.

Built upon a structurally annotated landscape of all alternative protein isoforms in breast cancer — integrated with transcriptomic expression, ORF-based translation, and protein structure modeling — this project seeks to identify **functional analogs of known therapeutic targets** based on 3D structural similarity.

Instead of relying solely on canonical drug targets, **3DisoTarget** opens a novel therapeutic dimension by uncovering structurally viable alternatives among isoform-derived proteins. This approach may provide new hope for patients with rare or target-negative tumors, who are currently underserved by existing therapies.

> ?? *3DisoTarget transforms a protein isoform atlas into a therapeutic discovery engine — unlocking possibilities beyond predefined receptor targets.*
